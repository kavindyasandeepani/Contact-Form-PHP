# Contact-Form-PHP
A fully functional PHP contact form project that allows users to send messages via a web form. The project includes form validation, proper handling of user input, and email sending functionality using PHP’s mail() function or PHPMailer. Ideal for learning PHP basics, form handling, and backend integration for small web projects.

# Configure Email Settings:
Open contact.php (or your PHP file that sends emails).
Replace the placeholder email and password with your own:
$mail->Username = 'your-email@example.com';      // Replace with your email
$mail->Password = 'your-app-password';          // Replace with your app password (not your real email password)
# Install dependencies
composer install
